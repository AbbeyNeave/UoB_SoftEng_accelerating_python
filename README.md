University of Bristol Software Engineering and High Performance Computing Project 1. The task is to accelerate the provided python file (the lebwohl lasher model of liquid crystals). Various approaches are taken to the task and each approach is optimised. The optimised approaches are compared using plots of their speeds against both number of Monte Carlo itterations and size of the lattice.
